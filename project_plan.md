### Twitter positivity change over time

<p>1. I would look at a corpus of twitter data from two or three different points of the site's history. [Here](https://github.com/shaypal5/awesome-twitter-data) is an example of where I could find twitter corpora, and I believe nltk also has a way of parsing twitter data. I would probably want a very varied and large sample so as not to be biased to a particular twitter community. Or maybe I want to focus on a specific community and do the sentiment analysis for them? That would reduce the size. </p>
<p>My goal with analyzing this data is to see if online culture, specifically twitter culture, has gotten more negative as time has gone on. People often say that social media is a plague, but I have seen a lot of productive discussions to contrast against any percieved negativity as people realize the potential of being this globally connected. I want to test the hypothesis that social media both "is more negative", and "is more productive" and see the relationship they have to eachother, if any. For negativity I will look for words with a negative connotation, and for productivity i will look for social and political and scientific jargon and see how frequently it is being used.</p>
