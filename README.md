### Project Description
This project looks at Twitter data from the [internet archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=twitterstream&sort=-publicdate) from 2011 and 2019 respectively. It compares and contrasts tweeting habits from both points in time such as content, lexical complexity, tweet length, and tweet sentiment.

- How is popular content of either era percieved or talked about?
- Have tweets become a medium for displaying more complex sentiment than they used to be?
- How does this complexity relate to overall sentiment? 

## Project Data

The main data used in this project came from a sample of the 2011 and 2019 [internet archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=twitterstream&sort=-publicdate) JSON files, where the top 1% of tweets were scraped from October of 2011 and September of 2019. There was also a classifier built for the sentiment analysis portion of the analysis which used the open source data from [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students), a pre-existing algorithm for sentiment analysis. Both the classifier data and the data used in the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Twitter-Positivity-Analysis/tree/master/data_samples)
